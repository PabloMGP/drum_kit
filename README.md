# drum_kit

This project is a simple drum kit that allows users to play sounds by pressing keys on their keyboard or by clicking on the corresponding elements on the screen. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

* Interactive drum kit that responds to both keyboard and mouse input
* Sounds for each drum component
* Simple and responsive design
* Easy-to-use interface

### Concepts Applied

* Flexbox for layout
* DOM manipulation for interactivity
* Event listeners to play sounds on key press and click
* Used the "keydown" event to detect keyboard input
* Used the "click" event to detect mouse input
* Created a function to remove the "playing" transition after it completes to avoid clashing with CSS key transition timing
